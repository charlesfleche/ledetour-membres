# json-membres-public

This is a Google Apps Script that reads user data from a Google Sheet and exports a JSON file.

# Change log
- 15 Nov 2019 - json now includes hours for all family members.

## Development Environment

- All development can happen in the browser using the Google Apps Script IDE.
- I used [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) to develop the script in my local machine but all files are pushed and hosted in Google's Script servers.
- Once the code is pushed to Google using clasp, the file extenssions change from .js to .gs.
